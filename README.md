A Repo containing various Ressources to Understand the Transformer model

## Basics:
## Advanced:
* Let's start with [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) The original Paper.
* A great Blog article By Harvard Nlp [Annotated Transformer](nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html). 
This paper give great Details (with code on the implementation)
* A great Article [Training Tips for the Transformer Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00247)
* a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer for NMT [Git here](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-openai-transformer-lm)
